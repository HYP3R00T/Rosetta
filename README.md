# Rosetta

## Why "Rosetta"?

The Rosetta Stone was a groundbreaking artifact that unlocked the understanding of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, enabling humanity to bridge the gap between lost and known languages. Similarly, this repository, Rosetta, serves as a tool for unlocking and sharing knowledgeâ€”bridging my personal learning with the wider community.

Just as the Rosetta Stone revealed complex systems of understanding, this project aspires to organize, manage, and share insights in a structured, reusable way. It's not just a repository; it's a gateway to learning, collaboration, and discovery.
